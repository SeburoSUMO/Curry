# Curry

(serves 1)

Put a bottle of ale in the fridge, preferably an IPA.  London Pride is perfect.  Lager is very acceptable (and should already be in the fridge).  Punk IPA, Fosters and craft ale is not welcome.

In a small saucepan:-

100ml of rice.

200ml of water.

1 frozen chopped spinach ball.

Cover with lid.

Bring to the boil


In a large saucepan:-

1 frozen chopped spinach ball.

Mixed frozen vegetables.

Full contents of a small tin of stewed steak in gravy or minced beef in gravy.


When small saucepan has started boiling, turn off the heat and (no matter what) do not lift the lid.  Leave for 15 minutes.

On an electic hob, set the large saucepan to 5.

Stir after five minutes.

With 2.5 - 5 minutes to go, add medium curry powder and still in well.

Remove beer from fridge and pour into a glass (if ale), or served in bottle (if lager).

When the rice has reached fifteen minutes, decant rice to plate, followed by the curry.

Best served with BBC Radio 3 J-Z jazz show.
